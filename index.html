    <h2>All the worlds a stage.</h2>
    <p>All the world's a stage,<br> And all the <strong>men and women</strong> merely players;
    They have their exits and their entrances,
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being <em>seven ages.</em>

    <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? (Sonnet 18)</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? <br />
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br />
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
  And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
  And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br />
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
  </p>
  <p>By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;<br />
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br />
  Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
  </p>
  <p>
  When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.<br />
  So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />
  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
  </p>
